    "Health is the most important thing in our lives. Due to this fact, the Fitness industry generated 30 billion USD in the USA in 2018. Every entreprenuer want to take a bite from this economy. One of the best and easiest way to participate in this is to open clean, well-staffed and modern Gym/ Fitness center. In my analysis, I will use data to find the best neighborhoods of Chicago to open a new Fitness center. This analysis targeted professional Fitness people who want to advance their situation and /or for entrepreneurs who want to make money in this huge Fitness economy."
